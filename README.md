## What This Is

A living document of my journey through Linear Algebra—from basic matrix operations to spectral theory. This isn't just a homework archive; it's a record of how abstract mathematics becomes concrete understanding.

**Core focus areas:**
- Matrix algebra and systems of equations
- Determinants and their geometric meaning
- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalization
- Vector spaces and linear transformations

**Applications in Computer Science:**
- **Graphics** – 3D transformations, projection matrices, rendering
- **Machine Learning** – PCA, SVD, gradient descent optimization
- **Algorithms** – Markov chains, PageRank, network analysis

## Repository Structure

### 📝 [Notes](./notes)
Theory, definitions, and conceptual breakdowns. Each topic builds from axioms to applications, emphasizing geometric intuition alongside algebraic rigor.

### 📋 [Assignments](./assignments)
Original problem sets covering proofs, computations, and real-world applications. Questions range from row reduction to characteristic polynomials.

### ✍️ [Solutions](./solutions)
Handwritten solutions with complete workings. The scratched-out attempts and margin notes stay in—they're part of the learning process.

## Why Handwritten?

Mathematics happens on paper. The physical act of writing forces precision in a way typing doesn't. These solutions preserve false starts, corrections, and the nonlinear path to understanding—the parts that textbooks edit out but students need to see.

## Philosophy

Linear Algebra is where abstract mathematics meets real computation. This repository treats it as both:

**As mathematics** – Rigorous proofs, formal definitions, logical structure  
**As computation** – Algorithms, numerical methods, practical implementation

The best understanding lives at the intersection.
