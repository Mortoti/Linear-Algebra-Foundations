# Solutions & Handwritten Work

This directory contains my complete, handwritten solutions to Linear Algebra assignments. Each PDF preserves the full problem-solving process—including scratch work, corrections, and the step-by-step reasoning that leads to final answers.

## Why Handwritten?

Mathematical thinking isn't linear. It involves false starts, crossed-out attempts, margin notes, and those "aha!" moments that only appear after wrestling with a problem. Typed solutions look clean but hide the actual learning process. These PDFs show the real work—the way mathematics actually happens.

## Completed Problem Sets

### 📄 [Matrix Addition](./Matrix_Addition.pdf)
**Topics Covered:** Basic matrix addition operations, element-wise computation

**Problems:**
- **Problem 1:** Adding two matrices
- **Problem 2:** Adding two matrices with mixed positive/negative values

**Approach:** Direct computation—straight to the solution without excessive setup or verification steps.

**What you'll see:**
- Clean, focused calculations
- Element-by-element addition
- Final answers clearly presented
- Minimal notation, maximum clarity

---

### 📄 [Scalar Multiplication](./Scalar_Multiplication.pdf)
**Topics Covered:** Multiplying matrices by scalar values

**Problems:**
- Scalar multiplication problems with various matrix sizes

**Approach:** Direct computation showing how each entry is multiplied by the scalar.

**What you'll see:**
- Straightforward scalar × matrix calculations
- Each element multiplied individually
- Clear final results
- Efficient problem-solving

## Coming Soon

As the course progresses, this directory will expand to include solutions for:
- Matrix multiplication 
- Transpose operations
- Systems of linear equations
- Determinants and inverses
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Each new problem set will be added with a similar breakdown explaining what concepts are covered and what to look for in the solution.

## Note on Academic Integrity

These solutions represent my own work completed for academic purposes. If you're taking a similar course, use these as a reference for *methodology* and *problem-solving approaches*, not as answers to copy. The value lies in understanding the process, not reproducing the result.
